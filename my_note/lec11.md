## Unsupervised Learning

- We implicitly think Euclidean distance as similarity
- Simple is best
- y, which is label, is gone and z, latent variable, comes in.

### k-Means

- Bad
    - Decision boundary is not specific
    - Unbalance between clusters
    - Sensitive on initialization
        - Enough distance between initialized points
