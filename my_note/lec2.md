## Linear Regression
ㅁ Steps  
1. Hypothesis is a function of X and y  
2. Restrict the function into linear function(affine function) w\ parameters & features  
3. By using OLS choose the best parameter  

ㅁ Adding more features can make linear model bad.
ㅁ At least d(# of feature)+1 data should be collected.

## Normal equations  
ㅁ Normal equation is usally used at small amount of data situation
