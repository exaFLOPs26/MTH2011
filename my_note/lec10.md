low complexity-bias error
high complexity-variaance error

Expected prediction error is divided into 3 sources of error(Need to induce it by self-test)

feature selection - domain knowledge

- Gradient vanishing
    - Residual connection 
    - RELU

- NN weight initialize should be random not all 0 or 1.
