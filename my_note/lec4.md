- b(y) the base measure depends on y.  
- a(Î·) the log partition function is given as sum of all probability is 1.

## Generalized Linear Models(GLS)

### Pick a link function (and distribution) based on target's type.

## Multiclass

- Using one-hot vectors  
- Using softmax function as our link function  
- For general k, a probability estimate for any k-1 class determines the other class  
- Using CrossEntropy as log likelihood function
